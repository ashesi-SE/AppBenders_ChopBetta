#AppBenders_ChopBetta
====================

An application to find out what meals are available at the local cantees.

•	The Scenario you are solving
Scenario Name: I need good food!

Problem:
People do not know ahead of time what foods will be available at the canteen. Sometimes they waste time scouting the campus for food they would like to buy. In addition, people do not know what their nutrient breakdown and the nutrients they may be lacking in the meals they consume. 

Payoff:
ChopBetta provides an interface where the food vendors can post a list of food they have available, so the Ashesi community can view this information at a remote area. Students and faculty/staff can hence have a fair idea of what the canteens have at any given point in time before they head there. Based on the feedback given in class, we plan to incorporate a crowdsourcing platform for those at the canteen to alert others if there are long queues and so forth. 

Payoff Scenario: 
Inez Marian likes to know beforehand what kind of meals would be available at Akornor and Mannies on a regular basis, and the nutrient content in each meal, so as to make proper health decisions with respect to food intake. Inez Marian opens the ChopBeta app on her HTC M8 and is presented with a list of available meals for the time period. She taps on her favorite fufu and goat light soup to view its nutritional content, after which she confirms to the app that she is having that for lunch. After a week of using the app, she is presented with analytics of her diet for the past week, and suggestions as to how she can improve it.
